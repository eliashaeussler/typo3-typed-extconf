# Contributing to TYPO3 Typed Extension Configuration

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This guide will
help you get started with development and ensure your contributions align with
the project's standards.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/typo3-typed-extconf.git
cd typo3-typed-extconf
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
composer install
```

### 3. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b bugfix/your-bugfix-name
```

## üìù Development Workflow

###  Code Standards

Before submitting your changes, ensure code quality passes:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `composer test` | Run complete test suite |
| `composer lint` | Check code quality (all linters) |
| `composer fix` | Apply automatic code fixes |
| `composer sca` | Run static code analysis |

These will be run against in the pipeline, too.
### PHP Requirements

- **PHP Version**: 8.2+ (project uses PHP 8.4 for development)
- **TYPO3 Version**: v12.4+ (project uses TYPO3 v13 for development)
- **Code Style**: TYPO3 Coding Standards via PHP-CS-Fixer

### Development Guidelines

1. **Type Safety**: Strive for maximum type safety to achieve high PHPStan levels
2. **Architecture**: Prefer composition over inheritance
3. **Classes**: Mark classes as `final` and `readonly` when appropriate
4. **Documentation**: Use concise, informal English for method and class docs
5. **Dependencies**: Always verify library availability before using
6. **Security**: Never expose or log secrets/keys

### Testing Guidelines

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Follow existing test patterns and naming conventions
- Ensure tests are isolated and don't depend on external resources

### Commit Messages

Please follow TYPO3's commit message guidelines since our semantic versioning
relies on proper commit messages:

```
[TYPE] Brief description (max 52 chars)

Optional longer description explaining the why and how.
Wrap at 72 characters per line.
```

**Types:**
- `[FEATURE]` - New functionality
- `[BUGFIX]` - Bug fixes
- `[TASK]` - Maintenance, refactoring, code cleanup
- `[DOCS]` - Documentation changes
- `[SECURITY]` - Security fixes (Approach the maintainers before committing
security related patches, please. Consult our [Security Guide](SECURITY.md) first!)
- `[BREAKING]` - Breaking changes (always include this when changing public API)

**Examples:**
```
[FEATURE] Add direct dependency injection for configuration classes
[BUGFIX] Fix parameter ordering in autoconfiguration callback
[TASK] Remove redundant attribute default parameter
[DOCS] Update developer guide with new DI examples
```
